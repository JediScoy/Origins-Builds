= scene
<b>Clun Castle</b>
You arrive at Clun Castle and find it underwhelming. Many stones have fallen from the outer walls, and thick mosses and ivy cover many of the stones. The tower is the only thing really left standing. The place looks more abandoned than occupied. You walk through the outer rubble, and enter the tower.
+ On the inside, <>
- it is surprisingly nicer. Beyond the vestibule, there is a small dining room with a doorway on the back wall, probably to the kitchen. There are stairs up to your right. -> vestibule

= vestibule
// Choices could be conditionally based on what options players have seen before
+ [Go through the door] -> into_the_kitchen
+ [Take stairs up] -> up_the_stairs
+ [Have a seat at the table] -> sit_in_dining

= into_the_kitchen
You head to the kitchen. No one is around except {~a couple rats chewing on moldy bread.|a few dozen spiders eating flies.}
+ You turn around and go back to the dining area. -> sit_in_dining

= sit_in_dining
You decide to have a seat. After ten creepy minutes alone,  nothing happens.
Leave the castle -> leave_castle_early
Go up the stairs -> up_the_stairs
= leave_castle_early
You walk back to the vestibule. A shadowy figure steps into the entrance front of you with a drawn dagger. You turn and bolt up the stairs .-> up_the_stairs
= up_the_stairs
You go up the stairs at a fast pace. It's probably the best place to look for the tower's master.
You pass seven floors before coming to a final stout door.
+ [You enter the top tower room]
- ...to be continued.
-> DONE

= enter_tower
With a gentle nudge of the thick wooden door, you enter the top room of the tower. The room is filled with tombs of knowledge, thick stacks of parchment, and apparatus scattered throughout.
-> END

// Early Arrival
= early
Besides the occasional bushwhacking the walk isn't too difficult and soon you approach the dark towerâ€™s main gate.
Stones have fallen around it.
+ [The place is clearly abandoned.]
- At least you <i>thought</i> it was abandoned. The Drow warrior slips from a shadowy side entrance. Blades move so fast they are a blur. This quickly ends your otherwise pleasant walk.
+ [Death]-> Death
Upon entering the tower room you see stacks of papers and books
-> END
