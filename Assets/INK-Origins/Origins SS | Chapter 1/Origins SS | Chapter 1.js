He therefore used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time. The third law was a masterpiece of simplicity: the square of the number of years of a planet's orbital period is equal to the cube of that planet's average distance from the Sun.","/str",{"VAR=":"keplerDescription"},"str","^Alatar","/str",{"VAR=":"mageName"},"str","^Aer","/str",{"VAR=":"healerName"},"str","^Darius","/str",{"VAR=":"warriorName"},"/ev","end",null],"#f":3}],"listDefs":{}};
